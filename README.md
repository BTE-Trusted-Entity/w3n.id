# w3n.id

W3n.id acts like a phone book â€“ for any given DID on the KILT blockchain, you can look up the web3name that is linked to it. Vice versa, for any possible web3name, you can look up which DID claimed it or if it is still available for you or others to claim. Furthermore, you can fetch credentials associated with web3names.
